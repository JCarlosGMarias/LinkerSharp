# LinkerSharp

LinkerSharp is (nowadays) a pure experimental attempt to port the most basic features of the Apache Camel Framework to a C#.NET flavor:

* A specialized DSL
* Message routing with transactional behaviour
* An easy way of adding custom endpoint components.

The original Java project can be found here: https://github.com/apache/camel
